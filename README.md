# MarLant

Sublime Text plugin for translating [SubRip/SRT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SubRip) subtitles. To clarify, it does not translate anything by itself, it just adds some conveniences for those awesome people who translate subtitles to other languages.

## Credits

- SubRip / SRT syntax definition is based on [this implementation](https://github.com/SalGnt/Sublime-SRT/blob/master/SRT.tmLanguage), converted to `.sublime-syntax` format with [SublimeSyntaxConvertor tool](https://github.com/aziz/SublimeSyntaxConvertor)
